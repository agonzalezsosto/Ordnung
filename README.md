# Ordnung

Ordnung is a system designed to create visual animations using platonic outlines in Max/MSP. It was designed to be used in the installation "Duality", presented with Andr√©s Leon (www.aleonsound.com) at Berklee College of Music in May-June 2018.

This Max Project contains the required Max patchers, and is not a standalone application. As such, it requires Max to run. 

Final version written in Max 8.

This folder also contains a Max for Live device called "Ordnung Control", which allows the user to control and automate the parameters of Ordnung using Ableton Live clips or the Live timeline.
